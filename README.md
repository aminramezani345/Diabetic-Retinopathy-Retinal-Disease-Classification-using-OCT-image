# Advanced Medical Image Classification Models

This repository showcases a collection of custom deep learning models, specifically designed for image classification tasks, with a focus on **medical image analysis**. The models are optimized for tasks such as the detection and classification of retinal images and other medical imaging tasks.

## Key Models Developed:

1. **AdvancedCNN**  
   A high-performance Convolutional Neural Network tailored for feature-rich image datasets, providing improved accuracy and generalization.

2. **CustomCNN**  
   A flexible CNN architecture designed from scratch to experiment with different layers and regularization techniques for various image processing tasks.

3. **ResNet18** and **ResNet50**  
   Implementations of the popular Residual Networks, which add skip connections to avoid vanishing gradient problems in deep networks.

4. **SE-ResNet18** and **SE-ResNet50**  
   Enhanced versions of ResNet architectures integrated with **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)** blocks to boost feature recalibration and attention mechanisms.

5. **SE-CustomCNN**  
   A custom CNN augmented with SE blocks to improve attention on important image features.

6. **SpatialAttentionCNN**  
   A CNN model incorporating **spatial attention mechanisms** to enhance the focus on key spatial regions of the input images.

7. **ViT-base**  
   Vision Transformer (ViT) implementation that leverages self-attention mechanisms for improved image classification performance.

8. **OCTID Dataset**  
   A dataset for Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) image analysis, aimed at advancing research in retinal image classification.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare the dataset (or use the OCTID dataset provided in the repository).
3. Select the desired model architecture and modify training parameters as needed.
4. Train the model using the dataset.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and more.
